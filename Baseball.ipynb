    "#The greedy assignment algorithm is used when speed is priority as it is fast and suboptimal method.\n",
    "#Apart from the Greedy Assignment Algorithm The Hungarian algorithm provides the optimal solution but it is comparatively slower. \n",
    "#Other Assignment algorithms include Network flow algorithms and integer programming and they provide exact solutions but are much slower. \n",
    "#To summarise we can say that the choice of algorithm depends on the specific job requirements of the problem and quality of solution and computational time."
